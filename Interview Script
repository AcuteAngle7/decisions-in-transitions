## INTERVIEW SCRIPT 

Thank you for taking the time to talk to me today. I’m interested in learning about two main things from you. First, I’d like to talk about your experiences as you switch from seeing pediatric doctors to seeing adult doctors. Some people call this “graduating” from a children’s hospital. I want to better understand how doctors and nurses can help young adults take care of their health. 

The second thing I’d like talk about is how you make medical decisions during this time of your life. For example, I want to learn more about how you decide to bring up issues with your doctors and nurses. There are no right or wrong answers, and I just want to learn more about your thoughts and experiences.

As we talked about before when I got your permission to be a part of this project, your identity will not be shared with anyone outside of our project’s team. Your name won’t even be used in the recording. would like to record our conversation to make sure I can pay attention closely to what you have to say.

Now I’d like to focus more about how you make decisions about your health. I’d like to talk about some imaginary situations where you might have to make a decision about your health. There are no right or wrong answers. I am just interested in how you might think about these things if they did happen to you. 

Let’s pretend that you see your doctor for a normal check-up. Your doctor is not able to find anything wrong but suggests starting a new medication to help keep you healthy. What would happen next?
