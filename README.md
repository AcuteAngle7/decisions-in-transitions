# Decision Making in Transition Readiness in Young Adults with Special Health Care Needs   

Young Adults with Special Health Care Needs (YASHCN) have chronic medical needs arising during childhood. During emerging adulthood, YASHCN face decisions in several contexts like education, relationships, and healthcare. YASHCN have increased medical complications during this time, especially without healthcare transition (HCT) support. Engagement in medical decisions may be an important component of transition readiness, the capacity to successfully transfer from pediatric to adult care. Most described HCT programs focus on certain conditions or exclude others like intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Thus, we explore decision-making in a broader population of YASHCN in a structured HCT program. 

## SpecifiC Aims 
1)	Describe YASHCNs’ perspectives on decision-making involvement during transfer from pediatric to adult care.
2)	Compare perspectives on decision-making among YASHCNs with and without IDD. 
3)	Explore YASHCN’s perspectives on decision-making in healthcare and non-healthcare contexts.

## Study Design
We propose a cross-sectional, qualitative study of YASHCNs in an HCT program at an academic children’s hospital. These patients are at least 18 years old and have at least two chronic conditions, IDD, or both. A semi-structured interview will investigate their experiences with decision-making and transition readiness. We wil also explore three decision-making scenarios: medication changes, new symptom management, and education opportunities. We anticipate approximately 30 interviews. Participants will complete the validated tool Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ). 

## Analysis 
We will report summative statistics on participants’ demographics, diagnoses, and TRAQ scores. Because of limited models on what constitutes transitional readiness, a modified grounded theory approach will allow systematic exploration of emergent themes while we conduct interviews. 

## Implications 
We wish to understand YASCHN’s participation in healthcare regardless of legal capacity, a traditional in pediatrics. Known HCT predictors like race and gender are not clinically intervenable so this engagement may provide opportunities to empower emerging adults and their social supports across multiple settings.
